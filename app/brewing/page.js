                    While attending one of the brewing group's meetings, I had the chance to gain a deeper understanding of the brewing process and the science behind it.
                    Working with --- and --- (two ---), the brewing group members explored not only ancient processes but also modern scientific principles.
                    Traditionally, brewing starts with grains like barley and emmer (an early form of wheat) being malted. Malting initiates germination, which activates enzymes needed to convert starches to fermentable sugars.
                    Using the pot created by --- and designed based on ancient pottery remains, we constructed a filter system that allowed water at 150Â°F to percolate through the malt.
                    This temperature was crucial to keep both alpha and beta amylases active and efficient.
